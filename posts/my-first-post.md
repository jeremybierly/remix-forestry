      Customers continue to expect more from a business' digital experience. The roles and responsibilities across organizations have bent towards technology services to meet these needs, both in strategy and execution.

      In both B2B and B2C spaces, executives are seeking to course correct from the overcomplicated technology that has taken root over the last decade. Having a thorough understanding of the digital experience landscape is crucial. Customers are demanding simple, uncomplicated solutions to their challenges as a result of the ongoing change and an abundance of choice. Technology executives must focus on simplification rather than continued over-complication.

      For example, real estate companies are leveraging technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, for digital walkthroughs; drones, for aerial imagery; and 3D modeling, to plan buildings and infrastructure. To design and build any one of these is a large undertaking, that is certain to require oversight and long term know-how.

      #### **Executive Leadership**
      Leaders must be equally adept at running a company as they are with knowing how to leverage technology to give them a strategic advantage to position their company as a market leader. They need to surround themselves with both internal and external resources that can provide them with digital expertise and thought leadership.

      #### **Technology Leadership**
      Leaders should consider how to bridge the gap between the features and growth of their products. Digital products must be built with a balanced focus on customer requirements, performance, security and their usability. This approach requires technology, product and digital marketing teams to be on the same page.

      #### **Data Leadership**
      Having a robust analytics and testing strategy can be a tremendous advantage in providing insights beyond anecdotal evidence. Technology leaders must be willing to listen and truly understand what their data is telling them.

      #### **Accelerate your team's maturity with easy tools**
      The successful organizations will be those who consider how a non-technical person might use their solutions, combining best-in-class software and tools with ease of use and a positive user experience. Digital empathy is a critical requirement and is one of the most challenging for technology executives.
